# PyTorch Deep Learning Projects

This is a repository containing various deep learning projects implemented in PyTorch. Each project is contained in a separate folder and has its own README.md file with details on the project.

## Projects

Here are the projects included in this repository:

- [Image Classification using CIFAR-10](https://github.com/Armos05/Pytorch-Deep-Learning-projects/tree/main/CIFAR-pytorch-main): An image classification project using the CIFAR-10 dataset and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- [Object Detection using Fast R-CNN and PennFudanDataset](https://github.com/Armos05/Pytorch-Deep-Learning-projects/tree/main/Fine%20Tuning%20Masked%20R-CNN%20for%20Pedestrian%20Segementation): An object detection project using the Fast R-CNN algorithm and the PennFudanDataset.
- [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Image Generation](https://github.com/username/repo/tree/main/gan): A project on generating synthetic images using GANs.
- [Natural Language Processing using LSTM Networks](https://github.com/username/repo/tree/main/nlp): A project on sentiment analysis using LSTM networks.
